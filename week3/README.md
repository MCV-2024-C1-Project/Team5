# Week 3
## Task 1.
- Filter noise with linear or non-linear filters
  - unknown noise model
  - only some images are noisy
  - show some examples from QSD1-W3

## Task 2.
-  Implement texture descriptors (LBP, DCT, wavelet-based, etc.)
-  Evaluate query system using QSD1-W3 using only texture descriptors
 - LBP, DCT, etc.

## Task 3.
- For QSD2-W3: detect all the paintings (max 2 per image), remove background.
- Create a binary mask to evaluate the method.

## Task 4.
- For QSD2-W3: detect all the paintings (max 2 per image), remove background, apply retrieval system, return correspondences.

## Task 5.
- Task 5: Submit your results for a “blind” competition in QST1,QST2
